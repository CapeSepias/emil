`[\/]` Emil is a library for dealing with E-Mail in Scala. The api
builds on [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) and
[FS2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2). It comes
with a backend implementation that is based on the well known [Java
Mail](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mail) library. As such it is
just another wrapper library, but also a bit different.

Please see the [microsite](https://eikek.github.io/emil/) for more
information.
